## MiniBaz2020 - HackMD / R Markdown

### Overview

This session will focus on the use of Markdown-based document creation.

We will start by introducing Markdown (a basic text-based document-creation language) 
in the context of creating reproducible research documents in R.

But first, let's take a look at a simple document written in markdown:

 * [markdownFile.md](https://github.com/mikblack/MiniBaz2020-HackMD/blob/master/markdownFile.md)

On GitHub, this file is "rendered" as a formated file.

If you click on the "Raw" button, you will see that it is just a text file,
written in Markdown.
