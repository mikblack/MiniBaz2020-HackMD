<!-- Run line below in R to render multiple documents: -->

<!-- Run line below in R to render multiple documents: -->
<!-- rmarkdown::render("multiformat_doc.Rmd", output_format=c("html_document","word_document")) -->

<!-- rmarkdown::render("multiformat.Rmd", output_format=c("html_document", "github_document")) -->

<!-- NB: Knit just does first one (HTML), which overwrites the md file, and  -->
<!--     deletes the directory of plots etc -->
<!--     Also, using HTML as the output format, and choosing keep_md = true -->
<!--     generates markdown that doesn't render the YAML header properly on GitHub -->

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
